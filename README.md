# NAAS PyTorch implementation
PyTorch implementation of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Gatys et al.

Differences:

* 16 layesr of VGG19 are used instead of just a couple.
* Shift activation has been implemenetd from [Improving the Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603) by Novak and Nikulin.

# CycleGAN PyTorch implementation
This is still very much a work in progress. The model is not successfull at its task as of yet.
